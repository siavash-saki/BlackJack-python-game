# Suggested Improvements

0. **Test**
   - Create tests.

1. **Modularize Game Logic**
   - Extract card, deck, and game loop logic from `blackJack.py` into dedicated modules (e.g., `cards.py`, `deck.py`, `game.py`) to simplify navigation and facilitate unit testing.
   - Convert the ASCII-art rendering helpers into a reusable view module so that future interfaces (such as a web UI) can share the core mechanics without duplicating code.

2. **Introduce Automated Tests**
   - Add a `tests/` directory with `pytest` to cover scoring edge cases (e.g., multiple aces) and dealer behavior when the player stands.
   - Use dependency injection or a wrapper around user input to simulate gameplay choices in tests, ensuring refactors do not break core rules.

3. **Improve Deck Management**
   - Replace the current list-shuffle-and-pop pattern with a `Deck` class that shuffles once, tracks remaining cards, and automatically reshuffles when low on cards.
   - Consider reviving `deckClass.py` by fixing typos and scoping issues, or removing it entirely if redundant to avoid confusion.

4. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Add input validation that reprompts on invalid bets without restarting the round and guard against non-numeric entries.
   - Provide a running history of wins/losses and clarify Blackjack payouts (e.g., 3:2) in the on-screen prompts.

5. **Document Dependencies and Usage**
   - Expand `README.md` with setup instructions, dependency installation (`art`, `termcolor`), and a quickstart guide.
   - Include contribution guidelines outlining code style, testing requirements, and how to run linting/tests before submitting changes.

6. **Prepare for Future Features**
   - Abstract bankroll and betting logic so multiple players or side bets can be added later.
   - Investigate packaging the game as a Python module with an entry-point script for easier installation via `pip`.
